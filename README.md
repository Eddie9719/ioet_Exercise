# ACME IOET

The company ACME offers their employees the flexibility to work the hours they want. But due to some external circumstances they need to know what employees have been at the office within the same time frame.

### Requirements üìã
The goal of this exercise is to output a table containing pairs of employees and how often they have coincided in the office.
Input: the name of an employee and the schedule they worked, indicating the time and hours. This should be a .txt file with at least five sets of data.

### Example

INPUT
- RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00                                                              
- ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
- ANDRES=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT
- ASTRID-RENE: 2
- ASTRID-ANDRES: 3
- RENE-ANDRES: 2
### Solution
My solution was to read the text file, then save the information in a map, since we can give a key and the content, in this case the key was the name of the employee and the content was his schedule.

Once the information is saved, I created a function that allows me to compare strings in pairs, The first string is the complete schedule of the first employee, the second string is an array with the schedule of the second employee.

### Example:
String one =MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00    
String [] two = {"MO10:00-12:00", "TH12:00-14:00", "SU20:00-21:00"};

Then I used the contains method in a for loop in this way  one.contains(two[i]) .... if this was true, my count would increase by one.

For this example: The string one contains "MO10:00-12:00" and "SU20:00-21:00", it means that the count is 2.

I made this for each employee excluding duplicated data to get the answer.


### Steps to run the program üîß

1. Open CMD, and use the javac command, if the cmd displays options we can go to the next step, if this don't work we need to add java jdk to the systems variables.
2. Change the directory of CMD to the src directory and use the next command 
```
javac Employee.java
```
4. Now we can run the program with the following command 
```
java Employee \Data\AcmeData.txt
```
